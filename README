# OSP300_auto-tool-set

## Information / Usage

### Usage

This program is for automating tool setting in Okuma CNC mills.

### Warnings

- This has only been proven on an OKUMA MU6300V-L with P500 control and Renishaw tool setter - \*\* **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK** \*\*
- I am not responsible for ANY damages or loss of any kind caused by using this program
- You may use this program and any revisions of your own
- Do NOT redistribute this program or any derivitaves without written permission

(Previous versions have been proven on Okuma MA500HII with P300 control)

## To adapt this for your machine

- This will run on other mills, with minor edits.
- For convenience: Map "OMTM5" to G111 within G/M code macro page
- Make sure you have **all .LIB files** in the machine's **MD1 directory** (DO NOT BLEND VERSIONS)

### OMTM_.LIB Edits

Definitions:

- PSRT = 1st VC# to have data written to
- PMAX = Maximum number of inserts to check (will only actually check number set in "PINS" variable)
- PEND = Calculated stop VC# (DO NOT EDIT THIS LINE)

Edit these lines:

``` G-Code
(DECLARE VC#'S TO BE CLEARED + USED)
    PSRT = 1 (SET START VC#)
    PMAX = 16 (MAX NUMBER OF INSERTS)
    PEND = [PSRT + PMAX - 1] (CALCULATE STOP VC#)
```

### OTDAT.LIB Edits

Follow instructions in program.

- PX, RTS, PINS will vary by tool and must be calibrated for each tool
- Note: **PY must be 0**

For horizontal mills:

- Will most likely want PX=0 instead of PY=0
- You will also have to change the logic to OTCH, you can use V3 as an example on the ALARMS (be *very careful* changing OTCH)

## To Use (After edits completed)

- Make sure tool is setup with correct PX, PY, RTS and INRT within TOOL LIBRARY in MTM3 program

- ADD OMTM to any desired macro macros into G/M code macro page. I use G111.

### Single insert set

>Sets length of single insert or tip of tool in spindle (HA length)

Usage:

- No modifiers needed

```G-Code
G111
```

### Multi insert set

>Gets length on all inserts of tool in spindle and sets highest as HA length

Usage:

- Use multiset modifier: PMLT=1

```G-Code
G111 PMLT=1 
```

### Break Detection

>Checks insert is within specific range, if not alarms out

Specify Range in "OTCH.LIB":

``` G-Code
OTCH

    NBRK (BREAK DETECT)
      M144
      VFST=#80H (BREAK)
      CALL OO30 PLE1=2.000 PX=PX PRS=PRS PGO=1 (2mm range)
      M145
      GOTO NEND

```

Usage:

- Use modifier: PBRK=1

``` G-Code
G111 PBRK=1
```

### Manual operation

> MDI

``` G-Code
T1 M06 (call desired tool to be checked)
G111 (use desired modifier if needed)
```

### Auto operation

- Add "G111" after tool change within program (Add multiset modifier if desired)
- Add "G111 PBRK=1" after toolpath to check breakage

## CNC Important Information

Tested controls / Machines:

- OSP500 - MU6300V-L
- OSP300 (V1-V3) - MA500HII
- P500 and P300 are very similar controls, I left local variables to a max of "4" characters for backwards compatiblity

## Previous Version Information / History

### V4 (Current)

- Revision Date: 07/29/2024
- Proven: OSP P500 MU6300V-L
- Capacity: Unlimited (16 Tested)
- Hard Programmed VC#'s: None
- Parametric Programmed VC#'s: VC1 - VC16
- Version Comment:
  - Revised to eliminate all hard coded VC#'s
  - Increased readability
  - Add seperate VC clear program
  - Eliminate unnecessary custom macros (G120)
  - Seperate tool page program for operator editting and program robustness, with simple instructions

### V3

- Revision Date: 09/30/2022
- Proven: OSP P300 MA500HII
- Capacity: 16 inserts MAX (due to passing variables)
- Hard Programmed VC#'s: VC98, VC99
- Parametric Programmed VC#'s: VC81 (LOW), VC99 (LOW + IMAX)
- Version Comment:
  - Updated OMTM#.LIB to contain parametric design
  - Now can choose VC#'s with LOW and IMAX local variables
  - All variables used = LOW - (LOW + IMAX + 2)
  - Still VC98 and VC99 are hard programmed in OINS2.LIB
  - Refer to **README_V3.md** for full description

### V2

- Revision Date: 09/29/2022
- Proven: OSP300 MA500HII
- Capacity: 8 inserts MAX - not scalable for more inserts
- Hard Programmed VC#'s: VC81-VC88, VC99, VC100, VC103
- Version Comment:
  - Updated OINS2 program for readablility and parametric programming

### V1

- Revision Date: 05/04/2022
- Proven: OSP300 MA500HII
- Capacity: 8 Insert MAX - not scalable for more inserts
- Hard Programmed VC#'s: VC81-VC90, VC99, VC100
- Version Comment: Original version

#### Additional macros involved in OMTM3/OMTM2

- M203 = single point measure
  -Replace M203 line (in OMTM3), if desired, with: CALL OO30 VFST=#81H

- G30 P1 = safe tool change rapid positioning.
  -Pxx are set within HOME POSITIONS page, can also add order to always retract Z first
  -\*\* *recommend not changing postions or orders that are set* \*\*
  -Change to XYZ moves if desired

## New features to implement

- Add operator warn, if VC#'s have data besides EMPTY before clearing
- Delete M1 and replace with dwell so operator doesn't need to hit cycle start
